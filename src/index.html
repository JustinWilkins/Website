                <p>
                    Hi, my name is justin my hometown is Avon NY, and I grew up with two older brothers.

                    I started work at a company called carestream as a quality assurance engineer
                    but quickly accelerated into a role as an automation engineer and eventually as a
                    software contractor.

                    Soon enough I realized that I enjoyed building and developing software, but I had a knack for
                    testing
                    and pointing out problems that others couldn't find. You can read more about my experience down
                    below.

                    I'm currenlty interested in roles that would allow me to build automated testing frameworks, and
                    drive better quality software, by developing quality testing software.

                    When I’m not immersed in automation, you’ll likely find me gaming, skiing, or riding on my
                    motorcycle.

                    Please reach out if you'd like to discuss any opprotunities you might have, or just to chat. I have
                    a contact page on my navigation header above.

                    Also, my cat Jimmy says hi.
